# Software IDs

This site is a catalog of known specifications for "Software Identifiers," data
formats used for identifying software. As described in CISA's 2023
["Software Identification Ecosystem Option Analysis,"][cisa] we are in a
multi-identifier ecosystem where no single identifier is likely to become the
singular common standard. These schemes serve different and often
complementary purposes, and can be used together to identify software
at varying levels of granularity.

This is intended only as a catalog, not a recommendation for a specific scheme.
